    "text": "Hello, my name is Keerthana, but most people call me Keer, I guess my name is a little tough to pronounce üòÖ. I‚Äôm turning 23 this year and‚Ä¶ damn, I feel old.\n\n\nI was previously a student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic where I studied Information Technology. I took a slightly longer route of four years in polytechnic because I came from the Normal Academic stream in secondary school and entered via the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP).\nNow, I‚Äôm pursuing a degree in Computing Science.\n\n‚ÄúI feel like it‚Äôs a mistake though‚Ä¶‚Äù\nI often wonder if Software Engineering would‚Äôve been a better fit because I love building things more than solving math equations BOOOO. Oh well‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n\nI want to be a developer. I‚Äôm almost certain about that. I just don‚Äôt know what I want to build yet, but I know I want it to be useful and meaningful to the world.\n\nüí° During polytechnic, I interned at Youth Corps Singapore where I used tech for youth volunteerism.\nüñ•Ô∏è Next, I‚Äôll be joining the Department of Statistics Singapore for my Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) where I get to design an application from scratch!\n\nHowever, I do struggle with this:\n\n‚ÄúWhat is meaningful to me? How do I cope when a task doesn‚Äôt feel meaningful?‚Äù\n\nDuring my IWSP interview, I was asked why my grades weren‚Äôt the best. I admitted that math-heavy modules just don‚Äôt interest me, even though they‚Äôre foundational in Computing Science.\nIt‚Äôs something I‚Äôm still working through.\n\n\n\nSome ways I like to spend my free time are:\n\nCooking (i‚Äôm glad you asked about recipes hahah)\nWalking and enjoying nature\nStreet Photograpy, started off with a film SLR but I recently got a fujifilm!\nListening to music and collecting vinyls\nTrying specialty coffees from different cafes\n\n\n\n\nFor my 21st birthday, I gifted myself a solo trip to Japan üáØüáµ. I spent 16 days wandering through beautiful places and my favorite was Nikko.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI visited Takayama and had my first onsen experience too.\nThe mineral-rich waters of the Takayama onsen improved my circulationfast and soothed my jointstired after a long journey.\nI also traveled to Korea with my mom and saw snow for the first time! Highlights included:\n\nStrawberry picking\nVisiting the DMZ tunnel\n\nA trip that I‚Äôm looking forward to is a trip after my OIP where I‚Äôll be going to Switzerland and Norway.\n\n\n\nOnce I ate something at Le Bon Funk, a restaurant in Singapore which had 3 components to it.\n\nChips\nTonburi (a vegetarian caviar alternative)\nFrench Onion Dip\n\nI tried to recreate it and I think I did a pretty good job.\nPS: I am a vegetarian and usually caviar is served ontop of the dip instead of tonburi. Tonburi is also known as ‚Äúcaviar of the field‚Äù \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut ultimate favoruite cuisine is Asian food. As I don‚Äôt consume meat, I find ways to enjoy local favourites like Mee Rebus and Lai Yao Kai and other meals made meatless. Most of my inspiration comes from my grandma and mom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot a movie buff but I like shows and my favorite show right now is House MD. Gregory House says:\n\nIt‚Äôs a basic truth of the human condition that everybody lies."

This suggests that larger engines are generally less fuel-efficient.\nLikes and Dislikes:\n\nLike: The plot clearly shows the relationship between engine displacement and fuel efficiency.\nDislike: The points are all the same color, making it less visually engaging.\nImprovement: Add color to differentiate points by vehicle class, e.g., aes(color = class)."

The colors are monotoned as well.\n\nImprovement: Rotate the x-axis labels for better readability"
